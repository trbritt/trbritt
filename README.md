# Welcome

As a doctor of physics, my research focused on high performance computation, and the optimization of advanced quantum mechanical simulations, affording me with in-depth technical knowledge of a wide range of physical, algorithmic, and mathematical principles and innovations.

Over my career, I have developed research-grade proficiency in `Rust`, `C++`, `Fortran`, and `Python`, and I have used these tools for a range of applications. My research at times involves the collection of extensive (~TB) datasets, and the efficient use of supercomputing resources, such as `MPI`, `OpenMP`, `Tokio/Rayon`, and `CUDA`, to extract and analyse the relevant information from the resulting data.

My abilities to utilise cutting-edge technology, to analyse and successfully execute solutions to complex problems, and my strong willingness to collaborate with my peers poises me as successful researcher.

I currently focus my research on cryptography, atomic and statistical arbitrage, convex optimization, and network / graph theory.
